TODO: cacheId should no longer be a parameter of create. Move it to a liquid state variable. Otherwise tests in causality/eternity will break. 
TODO: Take use of bower in some intelligent way...

TODO: Rebuild selections so that they refer to the objects they include, to avoid global id->object map.
TODO: consider selection logics and loop control... selectAll especially creates a need for loop control, but loop control could backfire... 
TODO: rethink and validate the unstreaming of indicies... what if the leaf of an index tree is unserialized first... then the referringObject cannot be determined...
